# netflix

This is my first project on Flutter.

The Subject was to make an Movie App.
On the HomeScreen we should be able to display Movies with Horizontal Slider.
Each movie display onTap the title, an image, the genre and the description on an other page.

An IU was excepted. I choose to recreate IU Netflix for the Project.
